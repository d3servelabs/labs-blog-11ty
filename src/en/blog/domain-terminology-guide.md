# **Complete Domain Name Terminology Guide**

Whether you're a beginner exploring domain investing or an experienced professional, understanding domain terminology is crucial for success. This comprehensive guide covers all essential terms used in the domain industry, organized by category for easy reference.

## **üéØ Domain Investment & Trading**

### **Domain Flipping**
The practice of buying domain names at a lower price and then selling them at a higher price for profit. Domain flippers often look for underpriced or high-potential domain names in auctions, expired lists, or direct sales.

**Example**: Purchasing `TechStartup.com` for $500 and selling it to a startup company for $5,000.

### **Premium Domain**
A domain name that is considered highly valuable due to its short length, common keywords, or brandability. These domains can fetch high prices on the market, sometimes millions of dollars.

**Example**: `Insurance.com` sold for $35.6 million, making it one of the most expensive domain sales ever.

### **Brandable Domain**
A domain name that is catchy, unique, and easy to remember, often used for business branding. These domains are particularly valuable for startups and companies seeking a strong online presence.

**Example**: `Spotify.com`, `Google.com`, `Airbnb.com` - invented words that became powerful brands.

### **Domain Portfolio**
A collection of domain names owned by an individual or company. A portfolio may include domains that are currently being developed, parked, or held for future sale.

**Example**: A domain investor might own 100+ domains across different niches like tech, finance, and healthcare.

### **Aftermarket**
The market where previously owned domain names are bought and sold. This includes premium domains, aged domains, and domains that are no longer in use.

**Popular Platforms**: Sedo, GoDaddy Auctions, Flippa, NameJet

## **üí∞ Pricing & Sales**

### **BIN (Buy It Now)**
A fixed price at which a domain name is listed for immediate purchase. Instead of participating in an auction, the buyer can choose to pay the listed BIN price to acquire the domain instantly.

**Example**: `SmartHome.tech` listed with BIN price of $2,500 for immediate purchase.

### **Tactical Pricing**
The strategy used by domain investors to price their domain names. This may include pricing a domain for quick sale, setting a high price for negotiation, or using BIN pricing to encourage instant purchases.

**Strategies**:
- **Quick Sale**: Price 20-30% below market value for fast liquidity
- **Negotiation**: Set high initial price with room for bargaining
- **Premium Positioning**: Price at market premium for prestige domains

### **Domain Auction**
A platform or service where domain names are sold through competitive bidding. The domain is sold to the highest bidder at the end of the auction.

**Popular Platforms**: GoDaddy Auctions, NameJet, Sedo Auctions, SnapNames

### **Escrow Service**
A trusted third-party service used to facilitate the safe exchange of money and domain ownership during a domain sale. The buyer pays the escrow service, and once the domain is transferred, the funds are released to the seller.

**Popular Services**: Escrow.com (recommended by ICANN), PayPal, Dan.com

## **üè¢ Professional Services**

### **Self-Broker**
A domain owner or investor who handles the sale of their own domain names directly without using a third-party broker. This can be beneficial for reducing costs, but requires more involvement in the selling process.

**Benefits**: Keep 100% of sale proceeds, direct buyer communication
**Drawbacks**: More time investment, need marketing skills

### **Domain Reseller**
An individual or business that buys domain names in bulk and resells them to end-users or other investors, often for a profit. Resellers may work through platforms or directly with buyers.

**Business Model**: Buy domains at wholesale prices, add markup for retail sales

## **‚öôÔ∏è Technical Terms**

### **TLD (Top-Level Domain)**
The part of a domain name that comes after the last dot (e.g., .com, .org, .net, .ai, etc.). The choice of TLD can affect the value and perception of a domain name.

**Categories**:
- **Generic TLDs**: .com, .org, .net, .info
- **Country Code TLDs**: .us, .uk, .de, .cn
- **New TLDs**: .ai, .io, .tech, .shop

### **Subdomain**
A domain that is part of a larger domain. For example, "blog.example.com" is a subdomain of "example.com." Subdomains can be used to organize different sections of a website.

**Common Uses**: blog.domain.com, shop.domain.com, api.domain.com

### **DNS (Domain Name System)**
The system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to communicate with each other. It is often referred to as the "phonebook" of the internet.

**Function**: Converts `namefi.io` to `192.168.1.1` for browser communication

### **WHOIS**
A protocol used to query databases that store registered domain name information. WHOIS provides details like the domain's owner, registration dates, and contact information.

**Information Provided**:

- Registration and expiration dates

- Registrar information

## **üìÖ Domain Lifecycle**

### **Renewal Fee**
The annual fee charged to maintain ownership of a domain name. If you don't pay the renewal fee, the domain can expire, and someone else can register it.

**Typical Costs**: $10-15/year for .com domains, varies by TLD

### **Backorder**
A service that allows someone to "reserve" a domain name before it becomes available for registration, especially when it is about to expire and is not yet taken.

**Use Case**: Secure a valuable domain that's about to expire before competitors

### **Dropcatching**
The process of registering a domain name as soon as it becomes available (usually after it expires) before others can get it. This requires specialized tools and timing.

**Tools**: DropCatch, SnapNames, NameJet

### **Domain Parking**
The practice of registering and holding onto a domain without developing it into a website, often monetizing it through ads or affiliate links while waiting to sell it.

**Revenue Sources**: Pay-per-click ads, affiliate marketing, lead generation
