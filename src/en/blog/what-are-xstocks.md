## What is xStocks?

_Bridging domain assets and tokenized equities onchain_

Tokenized equities or _xStocks_ have recently gone mainstream, with platforms like Robinhood, Coinbase, Kraken, and Bybit launching or planning offerings that bring U.S. stock access to crypto-native and overseas investors. What used to be confined to brokers and banks is now accessible 24/5, globally, via platforms like Kraken, Bybit, Coinbase, and Robinhood. **But what exactly are xStocks? These so-called xStocks are onchain tokens, backed 1:1 by actual shares, and storable in self‚Äëcustodial wallets, making them ready to slip into DeFi as collateral or liquidity.**

Now imagine not just trading in minutes, but milliseconds. Thanks to f.E. Solana-level speed, tokenized assets settle almost instantly often in under a second. In fact, Solana boasts settlement speeds around 0.4 seconds while blockchain transactions more broadly typically complete in just 3‚Äì5 seconds . As one expert put it, ‚ÄúTokenized financial securities could be traded and settled in milliseconds, like handing someone cash‚Äù. This kind of speed transforms domains, too: _imagine a premium_ **_.com_** _transferring ownership or being used as collateral in the blink of an eye, unlocking rapid liquidity and seamless utility._

For domainers who trade, tokenize, and sometimes fractionalize domain assets, this isn‚Äôt just stock news. It‚Äôs a playbook! Tokenized equities have created a model for transforming illiquid ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù assets into high-access, composable digital instruments. You could do the same with prime domains.

**Picture this:** a portfolio of premium .coms tokenized, fractionally owned, and tradable round-the-clock. Domain-backed tokens might be used as collateral, combined with other tokens in baskets, traded on global markets, or leveraged in creative DeFi strategies. The mechanics and infrastructure are already here. The transparency-proof systems mean token holders can trust that each token really is backed by a real asset, much like xStocks.

## Why this matters now

xStocks represent more than headline-grabbing innovation, they mark a shift in how we think about asset ownership. With DeFi-ready tokenization, legacy asset owners are discovering new pathways to monetize and mobilize value. And it‚Äôs accelerating. Coinbase is applying to the SEC for tokenized equities in the U.S., and Robinhood is rolling out 200 tokenized U.S. equities in Europe, even private company mirror tokens for SpaceX and Anthropic.

Domainers in the Web2 space have a powerful opportunity to align with this trend. Why stop at domains when you could create onchain domain+ equity baskets? Or let fractional domain investors stake to earn yield? It's all compatible with today‚Äôs xStock infrastructure.

Tokenized stocks show us what‚Äôs next: ownership without borders, transactions without frictions, and assets that move as fast as ideas. For domainers, it‚Äôs not just a stock story, it‚Äôs a preview of how tokenized domains can power the next wave of internet-native assets. With Namefi, that future is not theoretical - it‚Äôs deployable.

## The future? Global, composable, transparent and yours to claim.
