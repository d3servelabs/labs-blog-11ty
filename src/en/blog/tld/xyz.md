## **What is .xyz?**

The **.xyz** domain extension is a modern, flexible, and globally recognized top-level domain (TLD, a domain suffix that comes after the final dot in an internet address) that was launched in **2014**. Unlike traditional extensions like `.com` or `.net`, `.xyz` was designed to be **truly universal** â€” not tied to any specific industry, geography, or purpose. It symbolizes the **next generation of the internet**, where anyone, anywhere, can build and define their own online identity without constraints.

The name `.xyz` itself draws from the last three letters of the alphabet â€” representing the **end of the old** and the **beginning of the new**. Itâ€™s bold, catchy, and memorable â€” and it resonates especially well with **creators, startups, developers, artists**, and the **Web3 community**.

## **How People Are Using .xyz**

* **Web3 and blockchain projects** looking for decentralized brand presence.
* **Startups and entrepreneurs** seeking a fresh, short, and global domain.
* **Developers and designers** creating personal portfolios or open-source toolkits.
* **Innovators and experimenters** launching new protocols, apps, and digital communities.
