## **What is .org?**

The **.org** domain extension is one of the most trusted and respected top-level domains (TLD, a domain suffix that comes after the final dot in an internet address) on the internet. Originally launched in **1985** alongside .com and .net, it stands for "**organization**" and was initially intended for non-commercial entities, particularly **nonprofits, NGOs, and mission-driven organizations**.

Unlike commercial domains, `.org` has maintained its reputation as a symbol of **trust, transparency, and social impact**. When people see a `.org` website, they instinctively associate it with legitimate, credible organizations working for the greater good.
