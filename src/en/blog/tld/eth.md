## **What is .eth?**

The **.eth** domain is not a traditional top-level domain (TLD, a domain suffix that comes after the final dot in an internet address) but rather a **blockchain-based naming system** powered by the **Ethereum Name Service (ENS)**. Unlike conventional domains managed by ICANN, `.eth` domains are **decentralized, owned as NFTs, and stored on the Ethereum blockchain**.

`.eth` domains serve as **human-readable names for Ethereum addresses**, replacing complex 42-character wallet addresses (like 0x742d35Cc6...) with simple, memorable names (like alice.eth). This revolutionary system is transforming how people interact with **Web3, DeFi, NFTs, and the decentralized internet**.

## **How People Are Using .eth**

Since ENS launched, `.eth` domains have become essential infrastructure for Web3 users and organizations. They're widely used for:

* **Crypto wallet addresses** â€” replacing long hex addresses with memorable names like john.eth.
* **Decentralized websites** â€” hosting censorship-resistant websites on IPFS and other decentralized networks.
* **Web3 identity** â€” serving as universal usernames across DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and dApps.
* **DAO governance** â€” organizations using .eth domains for their decentralized autonomous organizations.
* **NFT collections** â€” artists and creators using .eth domains for their digital art platforms.
* **DeFi protocols** â€” major platforms using .eth domains for easy access and branding.

Because `.eth` domains are blockchain-native, they enable **true digital ownership** â€” you control your domain completely without relying on traditional registrars or governments.

## **Notable Entities Using .eth**

Many leading Web3 organizations and individuals have adopted `.eth` domains:

* **Vitalik.eth** â€” Ethereum's co-founder uses vitalik.eth as his primary Web3 identity.
* **Uniswap.eth** â€” the leading decentralized exchange uses .eth for their protocol governance.
* **OpenSea.eth** â€” the largest NFT marketplace embraces .eth for Web3 integration.
* **Compound.eth** â€” the DeFi lending protocol uses .eth for decentralized governance.
* **Major DAOs** like MakerDAO, Aave, and Compound all use .eth domains for their operations.

These examples show that `.eth` is more than just a naming system â€” it's the **foundation of decentralized identity and Web3 infrastructure**.

## **Why Choose .eth?**

* **True Ownership**: Owned as NFTs on the blockchain â€” no one can take your domain away.
* **Censorship Resistance**: Decentralized domains that can't be seized or blocked by governments.
* **Web3 Integration**: Works seamlessly with all Ethereum-based applications and services.
* **Multi-Purpose**: Functions as wallet address, website, and universal Web3 identity.
* **Investment Potential**: Premium .eth domains have sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
