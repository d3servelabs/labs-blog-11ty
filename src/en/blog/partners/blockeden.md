## **Introducing BlockEden.xyz to the Namefi Ecosystem**

BlockEden.xyz is proud to support Namefi in its mission to bring traditional domains on-chain. As Namefi redefines domain ownership by tokenizing Web2 DNS assets as NFTs—without sacrificing compatibility or usability—BlockEden.xyz offers the infrastructure foundation that enables such innovations to scale with confidence.

### **What is BlockEden.xyz?**

BlockEden.xyz is a developer-first infrastructure platform built for Web3 scalability and reliability. Headquartered in San Francisco, BlockEden.xyz provides high-availability RPC nodes, indexers, and analytics APIs for developers building on top of Aptos, Sui, Solana, and over a dozen EVM-compatible blockchains.

With 99.9% uptime, enterprise-grade API throughput, and over $50 million in assets staked, BlockEden.xyz is trusted by thousands of developers and projects globally.

### **Why It Matters to Namefi**

Namefi enables domains like `example.com` to be minted as ERC-721 NFTs, preserving DNS usability while unlocking new on-chain capabilities. This evolution requires robust infrastructure to:

* Serve high-volume read and write interactions with tokenized domains

* Power NFT marketplaces and domain trading protocols

* Support indexing, analytics, and event tracking for domain ownership histories

* Enable future DeFi use cases such as using domains as collateral

BlockEden.xyz provides all of this and more—through scalable, multi-chain APIs that can integrate directly with Namefi-based applications.

### **A Shared Vision**

Both BlockEden.xyz and Namefi are committed to making the decentralized internet accessible and usable by real-world users. While Namefi bridges Web2 and Web3 through domain tokenization (通证化), BlockEden.xyz ensures that these systems run reliably behind the scenes—fast, resilient, and production-ready.

As the Namefi ecosystem grows, BlockEden.xyz will continue to provide the developer tooling and infrastructure it needs to thrive.
