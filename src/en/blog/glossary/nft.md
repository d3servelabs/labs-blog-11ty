An **NFT (Non-Fungible Token)** is a unique digital asset that exists on a blockchain, representing ownership of a specific item that cannot be replicated or substituted. Unlike cryptocurrencies which are fungible (one Bitcoin equals another Bitcoin), each NFT has distinct properties and metadata. In Namefi's context, domains are converted into NFTs, making them tradable digital assets with cryptographic proof of ownership. This allows domains to be stored in [wallets]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/wallet/' | url }}), transferred instantly without intermediaries, and integrated with other [Web3]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/web3/' | url }}) protocols while maintaining their uniqueness and verifiable ownership history.
