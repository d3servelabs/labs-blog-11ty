**Domain trading** refers to the buying and selling of domain names as investment assets, similar to trading stocks or real estate.

[Tokenized]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/tokenize/' | url }}) domains transform trading by enabling instant transfers, transparent price history, and access to broader liquidity pools through [NFT]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/nft/' | url }}) [marketplaces]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/marketplace/' | url }}).
