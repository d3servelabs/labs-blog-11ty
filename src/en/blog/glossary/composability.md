**Composability** refers to the ability to combine different protocols, applications, or assets like building blocks to create new functionality. In [Web3]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/web3/' | url }}), composable systems can seamlessly integrate with each other without requiring custom partnerships or complex integrations. Tokenized domains on Namefi are inherently composableâ€”they can be used as [collateral]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/collateral/' | url }}) in [lending protocols]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/lending-protocol/' | url }}), integrated into identity systems, combined with other [NFTs]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/nft/' | url }}), or utilized in DeFi applications. This composability unlocks new use cases that weren't possible with traditional domain management, where domains were siloed within [registrar]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/registrar/' | url }}) systems and couldn't easily interact with other digital services.
