**Multi-sig (multi-signature)** is a security mechanism that requires multiple private keys to authorize a transaction, rather than just one. For example, a 2-of-3 multi-sig setup requires at least 2 out of 3 designated keys to approve any transaction. This is particularly valuable for high-value tokenized domains, where multiple parties might share ownership or where additional security is essential.

Organizations can use multi-sig to ensure that valuable domain transfers require approval from multiple executives, while individuals can use it to protect against theft or accidental loss of their domain assets.
