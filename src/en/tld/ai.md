## **What is .ai?**

The **.ai** domain extension is a country code top-level domain (ccTLD, a domain suffix assigned to specific countries or territories) originally assigned to **Anguilla**, a British overseas territory in the Caribbean. However, since the rise of artificial intelligence, `.ai` has been repurposed and embraced globally as the **premium domain for AI companies, tech startups, and innovation-focused businesses**.

The `.ai` extension has become synonymous with **cutting-edge technology, artificial intelligence, and forward-thinking innovation**. When people see a `.ai` website, they immediately associate it with advanced technology, machine learning, and the future of digital innovation.
