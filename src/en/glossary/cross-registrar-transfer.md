**Cross-registrar transfer** is the process of moving a domain from one [registrar]({{ '/en/glossary/registrar/' | url }}) to another, traditionally requiring auth codes, waiting periods, and coordination between [registrars]({{ '/en/glossary/registrar/' | url }}). This process can take days or weeks and may involve fees from both [registrars]({{ '/en/glossary/registrar/' | url }}). With [tokenized]({{ '/en/glossary/tokenize/' | url }}) domains, while the underlying [DNS]({{ '/en/glossary/dns/' | url }}) registration may still require traditional transfer processes, the ownership token can be transferred instantly between [wallets]({{ '/en/glossary/wallet/' | url }}). This separation allows for immediate trading and ownership changes at the token level, while [DNS]({{ '/en/glossary/dns/' | url }}) management can be handled separately. Advanced tokenization models might even automate cross-registrar transfers through [smart contracts]({{ '/en/glossary/smart-contract/' | url }}), significantly reducing the complexity and time required to move domains between different service providers.
