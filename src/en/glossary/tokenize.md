To **tokenize** something means to convert it into a digital token that exists on a blockchain. In Namefi's case, tokenizing a domain turns a real-world [DNS]({{ '/en/glossary/dns/' | url }}) asset (like `mybrand.xyz`) into a tradable, programmable [NFT]({{ '/en/glossary/nft/' | url }}). This token can be stored in a [wallet]({{ '/en/glossary/wallet/' | url }}), transferred instantly, or integrated with [smart contracts]({{ '/en/glossary/smart-contract/' | url }}). Tokenization gives domains internet-native properties like [composability]({{ '/en/glossary/composability/' | url }}) and automation. It doesn't change the legal status of the domain, but it does upgrade how you can use, trade, and secure itâ€”without relying on intermediaries.
