**Custodial ownership** occurs when a third party holds and manages assets on behalf of the actual owner, who relies on the custodian's policies and systems to access their assets. Traditional domain ownership is largely custodialâ€”[registrars]({{ '/en/glossary/registrar/' | url }}) control the domain records, renewal processes, and transfer mechanisms. Even though you "own" the domain, you depend on the [registrar's]({{ '/en/glossary/registrar/' | url }}) platform and policies to manage it. [Tokenized]({{ '/en/glossary/tokenize/' | url }}) domains shift toward self-custody, where you directly control the ownership token in your own [wallet]({{ '/en/glossary/wallet/' | url }}). While some aspects (like [DNS]({{ '/en/glossary/dns/' | url }}) management) may still involve custodial services, the core ownership becomes self-sovereign and independent of any single service provider's policies or continued operation.
