**On-chain** refers to data, assets, or actions that are recorded directly on a public blockchain. When a domain is "on-chain," its ownership and management can be verified and transferred via [smart contracts]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/smart-contract/' | url }})â€”without needing approval from a centralized [registrar]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/registrar/' | url }}). Namefi uses on-chain infrastructure to turn domains into [NFTs]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/nft/' | url }}), enabling instant, [permissionless]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/permissionless/' | url }}) transfers and integration with other decentralized protocols. This structure provides greater transparency, programmability, and control to domain holders. While the underlying domain still lives in traditional [DNS]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/dns/' | url }}), its tokenized representation lives on-chain as a secure and interoperable asset.
