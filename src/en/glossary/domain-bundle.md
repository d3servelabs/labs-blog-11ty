A **domain bundle** is a collection of related domains packaged together for sale, management, or investment purposes. Traditional domain bundles might include variations of a brand name, different TLD extensions, or thematically related domains. With [tokenization]({{ '/en/glossary/tokenize/' | url }}), domain bundles can be represented as collections of [NFTs]({{ '/en/glossary/nft/' | url }}) or even wrapped into single tokens representing the entire portfolio. This enables bulk trading, simplified portfolio management, and new investment products. For example, a "crypto domains" bundle might include domains like `bitcoin.xyz`, `ethereum.co`, and `defi.io`, allowing investors to gain exposure to the entire cryptocurrency domain sector through a single purchase or investment vehicle.
