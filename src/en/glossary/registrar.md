A **registrar** is an [ICANN]({{ '/en/glossary/icann/' | url }})-accredited organization authorized to register and manage domain names within the traditional [DNS]({{ '/en/glossary/dns/' | url }}) system. Registrars like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Cloudflare act as intermediaries between domain holders and registry operators. They control renewals, transfers, and nameserver changes through their own policies and interfaces. With Namefi's tokenization, while the underlying domain may still be managed by a registrar for [DNS]({{ '/en/glossary/dns/' | url }}) purposes, the ownership and transfer rights become decentralizedâ€”giving you direct control through your [wallet]({{ '/en/glossary/wallet/' | url }}) rather than being subject to a registrar's terms and dashboard limitations.
