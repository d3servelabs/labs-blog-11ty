**Cryptographic security** refers to protection methods that use mathematical algorithms to secure data and verify authenticity. In blockchain and [tokenized]({{ '/en/glossary/tokenize/' | url }}) domains, cryptographic security includes digital signatures that prove ownership, hash functions that ensure data integrity, and encryption that protects private keys. When you own a [tokenized]({{ '/en/glossary/tokenize/' | url }}) domain, your ownership is secured by cryptographic proofs that are virtually impossible to forge or hack with current technology. This provides stronger security than traditional [domain ownership]({{ '/en/glossary/domain-ownership/' | url }}), which relies on password-protected [registrar]({{ '/en/glossary/registrar/' | url }}) accounts that can be compromised through social engineering, data breaches, or weak authentication systems.
