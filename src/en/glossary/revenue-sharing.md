**Revenue-sharing** is a business model where profits or income from an asset are distributed among multiple parties according to predetermined terms. In traditional domains, this might involve manual agreements between domain owners and businesses using the domains. With tokenized domains and [smart contracts]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/smart-contract/' | url }}), revenue-sharing can be automated and transparent. For example, a domain used for a successful business could automatically distribute a percentage of profits to the domain owner, investors, or a community. This creates new monetization models where domain ownership becomes a source of ongoing passive income rather than just a one-time sale opportunity.
