**Lens Protocol** is a decentralized social media protocol built on Polygon that allows users to own their social graphs as [NFTs]({{ '/en/glossary/nft/' | url }}). Unlike traditional social media where platforms control user data and connections, Lens gives users ownership of their profiles, followers, and content through blockchain-based assets. Lens profiles use domain-like handles (like `alice.lens`) that function as both usernames and [NFT]({{ '/en/glossary/nft/' | url }}) assets. These handles can be traded, and the social capital built up around them (followers, reputation, content) moves with the owner. This creates a new model where social identity becomes a valuable, portable digital asset that works across different applications built on the Lens ecosystem.
