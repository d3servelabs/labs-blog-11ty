**Censorship-free** refers to systems that resist attempts by authorities or intermediaries to restrict access, transfer, or usage. Traditional [domain ownership]({{ '/en/glossary/domain-ownership/' | url }}) can be subject to censorship through [registrar]({{ '/en/glossary/registrar/' | url }}) policies, government seizure, or payment processor restrictions. [Tokenized]({{ '/en/glossary/tokenize/' | url }}) domains on decentralized blockchains are more censorship-resistant because ownership is secured by cryptography rather than corporate policies. While the underlying [DNS]({{ '/en/glossary/dns/' | url }}) system may still be subject to regulation, the ownership token itself can be transferred and held without permission from centralized authorities. This provides users with greater control and protection against arbitrary seizure or restriction of their digital assets.
