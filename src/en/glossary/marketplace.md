**Marketplaces** like OpenSea and Blur are platforms where users can buy, sell, and trade [NFTs]({{ '/en/glossary/nft/' | url }}), including tokenized domains. These platforms provide user-friendly interfaces for discovering assets, making offers, and completing transactions while connecting to users' [wallets]({{ '/en/glossary/wallet/' | url }}). Traditional domain marketplaces like Sedo or Afternic require centralized [escrow]({{ '/en/glossary/escrow/' | url }}) and manual transfer processes, while [NFT]({{ '/en/glossary/nft/' | url }}) marketplaces enable instant, trustless trading through [smart contracts]({{ '/en/glossary/smart-contract/' | url }}). When domains are tokenized as [NFTs]({{ '/en/glossary/nft/' | url }}), they gain access to the entire [NFT]({{ '/en/glossary/nft/' | url }}) ecosystem, benefiting from improved liquidity, transparent price history, and integration with broader [Web3]({{ '/en/glossary/web3/' | url }}) infrastructure that serves millions of users globally.
