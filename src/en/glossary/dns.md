The **DNS (Domain Name System)** is the internet's phonebookâ€”a hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names like `google.com` into IP addresses that computers use to locate servers. DNS is managed by a global network of servers and governed by [ICANN]({{ '/en/glossary/icann/' | url }}) through registries and [registrars]({{ '/en/glossary/registrar/' | url }}). When Namefi tokenizes a domain, the underlying DNS functionality remains intact, but ownership and management become decentralized. The tokenized domain [NFT]({{ '/en/glossary/nft/' | url }}) represents ownership rights to the DNS name, allowing blockchain-based transfers and management while the domain continues to resolve normally on the internet through traditional DNS infrastructure.
