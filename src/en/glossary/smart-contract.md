A **smart contract** is a self-executing program that runs on a blockchain, automatically enforcing agreements and executing transactions when predefined conditions are met. Unlike traditional contracts that require intermediaries, smart contracts operate autonomously through code. Namefi uses smart contracts to tokenize domains, handle transfers, manage ownership records, and enable advanced features like [automated delegation]({{ '/en/glossary/automated-delegation/' | url }}) or [revenue sharing]({{ '/en/glossary/revenue-sharing/' | url }}). These contracts ensure that domain operations are transparent, immutable, and don't require trust in centralized authoritiesâ€”creating programmable, [internet-native asset]({{ '/en/glossary/internet-native-asset/' | url }}) management that integrates seamlessly with other [Web3]({{ '/en/glossary/web3/' | url }}) protocols.
