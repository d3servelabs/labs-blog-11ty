**Farcaster** is a decentralized social network protocol that allows users to own their social identity and data rather than being dependent on centralized platforms like Twitter or Facebook. Users connect their cryptocurrency [wallets]({{ '/en/glossary/wallet/' | url }}) to create profiles and can move their follower networks and content between different Farcaster-based applications. Domains play an important role in Farcaster and similar protocols as human-readable identifiers that can represent social identities. A [tokenized]({{ '/en/glossary/tokenize/' | url }}) domain like `alice.eth` can serve as both a Web3 identity and a Farcaster username, creating unified digital identity across multiple decentralized platforms while maintaining user ownership and portability.
