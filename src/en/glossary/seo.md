**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** is the practice of improving website visibility in search engine results to increase organic traffic. Domain names play a crucial role in SEO through factors like keyword relevance, brand recognition, and link authority. Premium domains often have inherent SEO advantages due to their memorability and keyword relevance. When domains are [tokenized]({{ '/en/glossary/tokenize/' | url }}), their SEO value becomes part of their digital asset value proposition. Domain investors can now more easily trade domains based on their SEO metrics and potential, while businesses can acquire premium domains with established SEO authority to boost their online presenceâ€”all through transparent, blockchain-based transactions.
