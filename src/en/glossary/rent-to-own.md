**Rent-to-own** is a financing model where users make regular payments to gradually acquire ownership of an asset, typically used for expensive items like homes or vehicles. For domains, rent-to-own can make premium domains accessible to users who cannot afford the full purchase price upfront. [Smart contracts]({{ '/en/glossary/smart-contract/' | url }}) can automate rent-to-own agreements, handling payment collection, partial ownership tracking, and final transfer when payments are complete. This model could allow startups to gradually acquire valuable domains like `fintech.com` through monthly payments, with the domain automatically transferring to full ownership once the payment schedule is fulfilled, creating new pathways to premium domain ownership.
