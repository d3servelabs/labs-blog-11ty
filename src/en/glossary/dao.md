A **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)** is an organization governed by [smart contracts]({{ '/en/glossary/smart-contract/' | url }}) and community voting rather than traditional hierarchical management. DAOs allow members to collectively make decisions about treasury management, protocol upgrades, and strategic direction through token-based voting mechanisms. In the context of domains, DAOs can collectively own and manage valuable domain portfolios, make decisions about domain development or monetization, and govern domain-related protocols. Tokenized domains can be owned by DAOs, enabling communities to collectively invest in, develop, and benefit from high-value digital real estate while maintaining transparent, decentralized governance over these assets.
