**Collateral** is an asset pledged as security for a loan, which the lender can seize if the borrower defaults. In traditional finance, collateral might be real estate, vehicles, or other valuable assets. In DeFi and [Web3]({{ '/en/glossary/web3/' | url }}), collateral often consists of cryptocurrency or other digital assets locked in [smart contracts]({{ '/en/glossary/smart-contract/' | url }}). Tokenized domains can serve as collateral due to their verifiable ownership, transferability, and often substantial value. A premium domain [NFT]({{ '/en/glossary/nft/' | url }}) like `crypto.com` or `defi.xyz` could be used to secure loans, participate in leveraged trading, or access other financial servicesâ€”all while maintaining the domain's utility and potential for appreciation.
