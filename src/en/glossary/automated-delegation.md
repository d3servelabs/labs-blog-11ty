**Automated delegation** refers to using [smart contracts]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/smart-contract/' | url }}) to automatically manage domain control and delegation based on predefined rules or conditions. Traditional domain delegation requires manual intervention to change nameservers or [DNS]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/dns/' | url }}) settings. With [tokenized]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/tokenize/' | url }}) domains, [smart contracts]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/smart-contract/' | url }}) can automatically delegate control based on factors like payment status, time-based conditions, or governance decisions. For example, a [leased]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/leasing/' | url }}) domain could automatically revert control to the owner if lease payments stop, or a [DAO]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/dao/' | url }})-owned domain could automatically update its configuration based on community votes. This automation reduces manual overhead, eliminates human error, and enables sophisticated domain management strategies that execute reliably without intermediaries.
