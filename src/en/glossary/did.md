**DID (Decentralized Identity)** refers to identity systems that give individuals control over their digital identity without relying on centralized authorities like governments or corporations. DIDs use blockchain technology to create self-sovereign identities that users can manage directly. Domains play a crucial role in decentralized identity by serving as human-readable identifiers linked to blockchain addresses or identity credentials. A [tokenized]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/tokenize/' | url }}) domain like `alice.eth` or `bob.crypto` can represent someone's decentralized identity, serving as their Web3 username while being cryptographically secured and user-controlled. This creates portable, [censorship-free]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/censorship-free/' | url }}) digital identity that works across different platforms and applications.
