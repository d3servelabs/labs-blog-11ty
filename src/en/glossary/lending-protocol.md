A **lending protocol** is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrency assets without traditional intermediaries like banks. These protocols use [smart contracts]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/smart-contract/' | url }}) to automate lending terms, interest rates, and [collateral]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/collateral/' | url }}) management. Popular examples include Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO. Tokenized domains can participate in lending protocols as [collateral]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/collateral/' | url }})â€”users can lock their valuable domain [NFTs]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/nft/' | url }}) to borrow cryptocurrency, or earn yield by providing liquidity. This creates new financial opportunities for domain holders, allowing them to access capital without selling their domains or generate passive income from their digital real estate holdings.
