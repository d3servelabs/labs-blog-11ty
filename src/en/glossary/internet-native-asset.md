An **internet-native asset** is a digital asset that exists primarily or exclusively in online environments and derives its value from internet-based utility or networks. Unlike traditional assets that exist in physical form, internet-native assets are designed for digital environments and often have no physical equivalent. [Tokenized]({{ '/en/glossary/tokenize/' | url }}) domains are prime examples of internet-native assetsâ€”they exist as digital tokens, derive value from their online utility, and are managed through internet-based protocols. These assets benefit from properties like instant global transferability, programmable functionality, and integration with other digital systems, making them fundamentally different from traditional assets that were adapted for internet use.
