**Domain ownership** traditionally refers to a registrant holding usage rights through a [registrar]({{ '/en/glossary/registrar/' | url }}), often under restrictive terms. With Namefi, domain ownership means holding an [NFT]({{ '/en/glossary/nft/' | url }}) in your own [wallet]({{ '/en/glossary/wallet/' | url }}) that represents the real-world domain (e.g. `yourname.xyz`). This gives you clearer, cryptographically secured control over transfers, delegation, and integration. Instead of being subject to a registrar’s dashboard or policies, you manage your domain directly [on-chain]({{ '/en/glossary/on-chain/' | url }}). While legal obligations (renewals, trademark rules) still apply, ownership becomes user-first and programmable—unlocking new possibilities in Web3, identity, and digital commerce.
