**ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)** is the non-profit organization responsible for coordinating the internet's domain name system, IP address allocation, and protocol identifier assignment globally. ICANN oversees domain policy, accredits [registrars]({{ '/en/glossary/registrar/' | url }}), and manages the root [DNS]({{ '/en/glossary/dns/' | url }}) servers that keep the internet functioning. While tokenized domains operate on blockchain infrastructure, they still interact with ICANN-governed [DNS]({{ '/en/glossary/dns/' | url }}) systems for internet resolution. Domain tokenization doesn't change ICANN's role or domain legal obligations, but it does create new ownership and transfer mechanisms that exist alongside traditional [DNS]({{ '/en/glossary/dns/' | url }}) infrastructure, potentially requiring policy updates as the technology matures.
