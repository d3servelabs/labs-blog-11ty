**Permissionless** refers to systems that allow anyone to participate without requiring approval from a central authority. In blockchain contexts, permissionless networks let users transact, build applications, or interact with protocols without gatekeepers. Traditional domain management requires permission from [registrars]({{ '/en/blog/glossary/registrar/' | url }}) and follows their policies, but tokenized domains on Namefi enable permissionless transfers and integrations. Once you own a tokenized domain, you can trade it, use it in DeFi protocols, or build applications around it without seeking approval from intermediariesâ€”as long as the underlying blockchain network is accessible to you.
