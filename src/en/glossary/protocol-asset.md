A **protocol asset** is a digital asset that serves as a fundamental building block or infrastructure component within a blockchain protocol or decentralized system. These assets often have utility beyond simple value storage, providing functionality that other applications and services can build upon. [Tokenized]({{ '/en/glossary/tokenize/' | url }}) domains function as protocol assets by serving as identity layers, namespace systems, and integration points for Web3 applications. They provide utility to the broader ecosystem while being [composable]({{ '/en/glossary/composability/' | url }}) with other protocols. For example, a [tokenized]({{ '/en/glossary/tokenize/' | url }}) domain might serve as [collateral]({{ '/en/glossary/collateral/' | url }}) in DeFi, identity in social protocols, and naming in [wallet]({{ '/en/glossary/wallet/' | url }}) systemsâ€”making it a multi-functional protocol asset.
